# music-sync-frontend

This project is a C# WPF application that I created to explore Spotify's API and its authentication flow using PKCE.

The main purpose of this project is to enable real-time song synchronization between users through a WebSocket server.

It is designed to work alongside the [MusicSync](https://github.com/BenjaminBelanger/music-sync-backend) backend Node.js server.
